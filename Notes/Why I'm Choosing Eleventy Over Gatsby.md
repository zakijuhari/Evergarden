## For Knowledge Prosperity
At the end of February, I've decided to work on a personal side-project of publishing my Evergreen notes on Github. The motivation behind this is to find a permanent and central location for personal knowledge management. Over the years I have lost many written notes that are now lost simply because I had been undecisive and jumped from one app to another without bothering to migrate the notes. Re-researching and re-writing knowledge that I know I know but yet feel like I don't, is an inefficiency that generates frustration and insecurity. This lack of an obvious cumulation of knowledge has been a source of rumination for far too long. This Github repo is my answer to my own conundrum.
	
	
## Eleventy with Github Pages
The choice between Eleventy and Gatsby boils down to requirements. Fundamentally, all I want to achieve is to have a way for me to view my notes on the web. Not just for referencing my notes, but to inspire confidence that I have some semblance of intellectual growth.

As **simplicity is the focus**, the simpler choice is the answer. Whilst I am attracted to Gatsby, it appears far too technical for me. Right now, the immediate needs is to build a simple and beautiful static site for my notes, and Eleventy looks like the right candidate. I am more interested in front-end design with HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript for progressive aesthetic enhancements (i.e transitions and micro-animation) then to delve deep into Javascript as a full-stack web development.
	
	
## Why Not Middleman or Jekyll
I had used Middleman before over a decade ago, but the knowledge to build another static site using Middleman has been forgotten along with whatever posts I published on that site. And whilst there is an official Github guide to use Jekyll with Github Pages, I really would like to get familiar with Javascript a little bit more.
